#  Final project

Machine learning classifiers for diagnosis Alzheimer with handwriting

## Description
The aim of this project is to determine, among three supervised machine learning methods - logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier - which one provides better results in distinguishing between individuals with Alzheimer's disease and those without it.

This is significant for two reasons: I) neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's have no cure and affect both mental and motor capacities, and II) an increase in the incidence of these diseases is expected in the coming decades due to the rise in life expectancy, creating the need for early diagnosis.

For this reason, researcher Nicole D. Cilia and others conducted a study on handwriting, collecting data from 174 individuals, including 89 Alzheimer's patients and 85 individuals without the condition. This formed the DARWIN dataset (Diagnosis AlzheimeR WIth haNdwriting), which was utilized in this project. 

This dataset was obtained by considering 18 handwriting features, collected through the execution of 25 writing or drawing tasks with varying levels of complexity, all gathered using a graphic tablet.
